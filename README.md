# Unit-convert-v2

Second attempt at making a unit converter. 


Now with option to select which unit to convert to which unit, instead of converting all at once as in my previous project app. 
This is still far from optimal, but as with almost any project I start, it is 99% code from my head and what I picked up during the courses.
